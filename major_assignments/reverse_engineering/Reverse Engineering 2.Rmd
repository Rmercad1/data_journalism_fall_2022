Reverse Engineer 2 Notebook

Objective: Analyze data from the Blair and Elrich campaigns for county executive from 2018 and 2022.

###Question 1:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)

```



First thing we did is load up the sets and clean the data:

##Blair 2018 contribs:

```{r}
blair_contribs_2018 <-read.csv("data2/blair_contribs_2018.csv")
```

```{r}

clean_names  
  
  
blair_contribs_2018_cleaned %>%   
mutate(contribution_date = mdy(contribution_date)) 
blair_contribs_2018_cleaned
```


###Blair 2022 contribs

```{r}

##County primary election results:



```{r}

```

```{r}
dem_precincts_22 <- read.csv("data2/dem_precincts_2022.csv")
```





```{r}
dem_county_22 <- read.csv("data2/dem_county_2022.csv")

```




###Question 1 1. How much money did David Blair and Marc Elrich fund themselves in 2022 vs. 2018? Blair is a businessman and millionaire, so it makes sense that he’s funding his own campaign. But how much exactly is he putting into it, and how does it compare to the past election and to how much Elrich’s campaign is raising?

###2022:

```{r}
blair_contribs_2022_cleaned %>%
filter(contributor_name == "BLAIR  DAVID  THOMAS") %>%
group_by(contributor_name) %>%
summarize(total_blair = sum(contribution_amount))
```

```{r}
elrich_contribs_2022_cleaned %>%
group_by(contributor_name) %>%
summarize(total_elrich = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_elrich))
```
###2018:

```{r}
blair_contribs_2018_cleaned %>%
filter(contributor_name == "BLAIR  DAVID  THOMAS") %>%
group_by(contributor_name) %>%
summarize(total_blair = sum(contribution_amount))
```
```{r}
elrich_contribs_2018_cleaned %>%
group_by(contributor_name) %>%
summarize(total_elrich = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_elrich))
```
 
###Question 2: Who were the top 5 contributors to Blair and Elrich in 2022? How about in 2018? What are their connections to the candidates?


###2022
```{r}
top_blair_contribs_22 <- blair_contribs_2018_cleaned %>%
  mutate(contributor_name = case_when(
    contributor_name == "BLAIR  DAVID  THOMAS" ~ "Blair  David  Thomas",
    TRUE ~ contributor_name
  )) %>%
  group_by(contributor_name) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(5)
top_blair_contribs_22
```

```{r}
top_elrich_contribs_22 <- elrich_contribs_2022_cleaned %>%
  group_by(contributor_name) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(6)
top_elrich_contribs_22
```

###2018

```{r}
top_blair_contribs_18 <- blair_contribs_2018_cleaned %>%
  mutate(contributor_name = case_when(
    contributor_name == "BLAIR  DAVID  THOMAS" ~ "Blair  David  Thomas",
    TRUE ~ contributor_name
  )) %>%
  group_by(contributor_name) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(5)
top_blair_contribs_18
```

```{r}
top_elrich_contribs_18 <- elrich_contribs_2018_cleaned %>%
  group_by(contributor_name) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(6)
top_elrich_contribs_18
```

###Question 3: David Blair got more early/election day votes in 2022. Elrich got more Mail-in votes in 2022. How did that compare to 2018? People want to know how Marc Elrich won both times, first by 72 voters in 2018 and then 32 in 2022. Where did Marc do well in the three categories: Early voting, election day, and mail-in votes. Did this sway the result at all?

```{r}
dem_county_18_cleaned <-dem_county_18 %>% 
  clean_names()
```


```{r}
dem_county_22_cleaned <-dem_county_22 %>% 
  clean_names()
```



```{r}

blair <- dem_county_18_cleaned %>%
filter(candidate_name == "David Blair")
elrich <-  dem_county_18_cleaned %>%
  filter(candidate_name == "Marc Elrich")
blair_elrich <-  bind_rows(blair, elrich)
blair_elrich
```





###Question 4: Which parts of the county voted for Elrich and which voted for Blair based on precinct-level voting? Are there differences in demographics of those areas? What about income?

Blair-Elrich Map diff:

First impressions of this map show me that Marc Elrich won in the raciall diverse areas of the county. This includes Silver Spring, Takoma Park (his home), Rockville, parts of Bethesda, and interestingly some of the white-dominated suburbs in the eastern part of the county such as Ashton, Sandy Spring, Colesville, Cloverly, and others. Elrich also won the western peripheries of the county such as Poolesville and Barnesville.

As for Blair, he won what I would characterize as "the rich" areas of the county, which includ Chevy Chase, and Potomac. Interestingly, When looking at other places that Blair won, he also won places like Rockville, Gaithersburg, Germantown, Olney, and the upper sparsly-populated portions of the county. Income-wise, these areas are not as uniform in their high median incomes like Chevy Chase and Potomac. 

One interesting place where Blair one was in the eastern part of the county amonf a swath of Elrich votes. This is Kemp Mill. According to Census figures found at https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/kempmillcdpmaryland, the medium household income is $140,000. But that doesn't answer the question of why they voted for Blair over Elrich. Another reason could be its demographics. The area is very Jewish and, according to the Washington Examiner, https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tightly-knit-kemp-mill, has a very large orthodox Jewish voting pattern. Its unclear if this had any impact on the race since its unknown what Blair's religion is. Elrich himself is Jewish, but in this case, the Orthodox community may not have voted for him? Its hard to say. Other largely jewish areas of the county such as Chevy Chase, parts of Rockville, and Potomac also voted for Blair.

  filter(elrich_blair_diff >= 10)

```
Map two:

This map shows where the the percentage between Blair and Elrich was larger than 20%. What I see here is that the majority of the county was competitive, regardless of where you were. Blair won by somewhat big margins in areas like Potomac, which doesn't surprise me. Potomac has one of the highest median incomes in the county and Blair himself is a businessman millionaire. The other areas he somewhat won by a little bigger margin are Kemp Mill in the eastern part of the county, and upper Montgomvery County near Mt. Airy.

###Question 5: Where did David Blair and Marc Elrich spend their money on campaign finance resources? Ie: Meta advertisements, yard signs, TV, consulting? This would be interesting to know since Blair made a very big concerted effort to build his profile during the campaign while Elrich relied on incumbency and mainly TV ads to help him. 


```{r}
blair_expenses_2022_cleaned %>%
group_by(expense_category) %>%
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_category))
#spent nearly $3.1 mil in 2022 ... top 3 are Media, Salarties and Direct Mail by Mail House (R)
```
#dive into media
```{r}
blair_expenses_2022_cleaned %>%
filter(expense_category == "Media") %>%
group_by(expense_purpose) %>%
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_category))
```
# Spent 1773.00	 on online advertising

```{r}
elrich_expenses_2022_cleaned %>%
group_by(expense_category) %>%
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_category))
```
Elrich spent $528393.29 on media which is significantly less than Blair

```{r}
elrich_expenses_2022_cleaned %>%
filter(expense_category == "Media") %>%
group_by(expense_purpose) %>%
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>%
arrange(desc(total_category))
```

#Elrich spent 32K on consulting fees.

This is what I wrote for No. 5 "There are signifant differences in spending between Elrich and Blair here and it shows how the capital on hand can really influence the means a candidate has to win or lose a race. Elrich in 2022 went all-in on TV spending. Blair spent a lot more in 2018 as well."
